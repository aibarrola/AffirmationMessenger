# Affirmation Messenger
Allows VSA members to create an envelope and write affirmations to other members 
---
__Context__: At the end of the year, VSA would come together for one last event called End of the Year Banquet and you were able to write your name on envelopes and tape it to the wall. Throughout the event, members would be able to write affirmation notes and put them in member's envelopes. However VSA was not able to host this last event due to COVID-19 so this was my way of keeping the affirmations alive by digitalizing the process. 

__Challenges__: One big challenge was time. I had the vision to make this happen but it was during a time where I had finals week and VSA responsibilities to take care of, but I was determined to make this website happen. Other technical challenges include long messages and names bineg visible. 

__Results__: Launched website for VSA members resulting in over 75 users and over 500 sent affirmations. Designed wireframe and developed intuitive front-end UI to replicate real experiences with letters
